            Hi, and welcome to PJ's Childminding.
            <br/>
            My name is Paula and together with my husband Paul, we run a
            registered childminding service in our home setting in the town of Cullompton, Devon. We are proud to have built
            up our setting from a GOOD Ofsted grade in 2008, to now now achieving a consistent OUTSTANDING grade.
            <br/><br/>
            We take pride in providing our setting within our own home, including a  fully fenced garden with both a lawn and
            patio area (which includes an awning). Our garden is equipped with a trampoline (complete with safety netting), a
            Wendy house, a mud kitchen, an outdoor water tray and a selection of other outdoor toys. Inside our home we dedicate
            our ground floor to the setting including a downstairs toilet and sleeping facilities where required.
            <br/><br/>
            We strive to work towards the targets of the EYFS (Early Years Foundation Stage) learning programs on a daily basis,
            as well as daily outdoor exercise to burn off excess energy. Before the COVID-19 pandemic, we also regularly went on
            day trips, be it a local park, the library, a soft play center or a session at a nearby forest school. We and the
            children thoroughly enjoy these activities and hope to return to being able to do this once the situation has improved.
